                                    dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal
                                    congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are
                                    usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
                                    don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
                                    (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special
                                    treatment. <br><br>Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19
                                    becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,

                                    heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                                    People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical

                                <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
                                    disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from
                                    the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19
                                    coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces
                                    around the person.<br><br> Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching
                                    these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
                                    People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
                                    person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is
                                    why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a
                                    person who is sick.</p>

                                <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly

                                <p>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person
                                    appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may
                                    be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main
                                    feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways
                                    COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because
                                    this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,
                                    after using the bathroom and before eating.</p>

                                <h3>Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</h3>
                                <p>The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets
                                    expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19
                                    from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many
                                    people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is
                                    particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore
                                    possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just
                                    a mild cough and does not feel ill.</p>

                                <p>The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whether
                                    there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
                                    For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
                                    still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or
                                    areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
                                    these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments
                                    and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new
                                    case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
                                    restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with
                                    disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading
                                    COVID-19.
                                    COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as
                                    has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,
                                    new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the
                                    situation where you are or intend to go.</p>

                                    about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is
                                    therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19
                                    outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.<br>
                                    We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
